# About

This is a repository meant to be used with Obsidian, though any markdown editor will work. It is intended that you have your own `personal` folder where you store your own notes, and those will not be tracked with github. You can then pull down public changes or create PRs for changes to public. 

Anything not in the personal folder will be tracked by git

- 6 miles long, 3 miles wide at widest point, shaped like a whale

- “Blowhole” of the whale is a semi-active volcano called Mount Gesrim, though one side of the mount has collapsed, leading to lava primarily flowing out of the western side

- Island is completely overgrown with rainforests save for the rocky coasts and side of mount Gesrim

- Island is completely overrun with elementals, primarily fire and earth, due to the presence of the volcano and a historic presence on and within the island that runs deep. Humanoid societies do exist on the island, but are isolated in various ways

- 7 population centers exist: [[Bronzenport]] (western coast, small city, largely dwarvish), [[Bristecage]] (eastern side of Mount Gesrim, Large tribal settlement, largely genasi), [[Nandras Bay]] (northeast coast, tribal settlement, largely genasi), [[Underharbor]] (north coast, large town, multicultural); the 3 canopy settlements, [[Anhurse]] (directly south of Mount Gesrim, town, fully diverse), [[Nivara]] (slightly south-east of island center, large town, fully diverse), and [[Reineer]] (south end of island, small town, fully diverse)

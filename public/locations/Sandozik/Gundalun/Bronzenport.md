- A heavily fortified port city on Gundalun, surrounded by towering bronze walls to defend against elementals.
- Primarily populated by dwarves (60%), with a government led by the Bronze Port Mercantile Collective.

- Due to limited space, the city is cramped, with narrow streets and stacked housing.

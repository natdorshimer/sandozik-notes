- A vast grassland in southern Sandozik, bordered by Sharandar Woods to the west, Helm Hills to the north, and Wrenmere Mire to the east.
- Made up of rolling plains with patches of fertile farmland and occasional rocky outcrops. The region experiences hot summers and milder winters, with frequent strong winds due to the lack of natural barriers.
- Sparsely populated compared to other regions, with small and medium farming villages and ranches spread throughout. [[Theos Town]] (9,000) is the largest town in the region, known for its agricultural exports. That being said, Wakual does sit in the south of this region and as such serves as a much larger population center.
- The region is home to human, halfling, and dwarven farming communities, though Fairtrade practitioners dominate the cultural landscape. There is also a considerable urban population in Wakual, but Wakual is a very spread out city and gradually blends into the surrounding farmlands.
- Known as the breadbasket of Sandozik, supplying wheat, barley, and livestock to the surrounding nations. Trade routes connect to Goldrise, Oftwinter, Kryptgarden, and a number of coastal ports that allow trade with Gundalun.
- Fairtrade is the dominant faith, with many farmsteads featuring shrines to Waukeen or the Lightkeepers. No religions are banned within the region, but no others have taken hold beyond a handful of practitioners.
- The open terrain of the plains and the distance between towns makes them vulnerable to raiding parties from Sharandar Woods, particularly from bandit groups like those from Ren’s Grotto.
- Notable Features:
	- The Golden Road – A well-traveled trade route connecting Wakual to Oftwinter, patrolled by merchant-funded militias.
	- The Dead Hearth – A large ruined village abandoned after a plague, now considered haunted by restless spirits.

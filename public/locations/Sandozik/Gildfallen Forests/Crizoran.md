**Population:** 2100

- A town known for its skilled healers, sitting deep within the forests.
- Sits within Gildenfall forest at the edge of The Deepwood.
- The Oren Counci (and eternism) have less of a hold here due to how far away and remote Crizoran is. As a result, some individuals openly practice other religions, though this frequently causes conflict with the handful of celestials that tend to the town and surrounding region.
- Druidics is practiced in the town by several people and even has a Leshy population, though the Oren council cracks down on this and has tried to make examples of individuals with executions in the past, though this has ultimately only increased tensions and dissent.

# Origination & Historical Development 

- Like all other forms of magic, Druidic magic was destroyed during The Sunder.

- It was gradually rediscovered over the following centuries, and was one of the first magical traditions to re-emerge alongside divine magic.

- Unlike structured faiths, Druidics was not reintroduced through doctrine, but instead rekindled through lived experience, passed down orally and adapted across various cultures.

- Druidics are actively deepening with new connections to natural sources of magic being found every couple of decades, and many groups actively exploring and creating beliefs around these manifestations.

- Druidic practice remains fluid and decentralized, evolving based on the needs of the land and the balance of nature.
    

# Core Beliefs & Structure

- Druidics is a vast umbrella faith, encompassing many traditions that vary based on region, ancestry, and philosophical approach.

- ## Common Themes Across Druidic Traditions:
	1. The Cycle of Life – Death and rebirth are not endpoints, but transitions that feed into the continued existence of the realm.
	    
	2. Respect for Nature – Nature is a teacher, protector, and destroyer. It must be understood and respected rather than controlled.
	    
	3. Reverence of the Elements – Many groups focus on specific elemental forces and beings, believing them to be manifestations of the realm’s will.
	    
	4. Guidance of the Stars – Some practitioners seek insight from celestial patterns, using the sky as a guide for understanding balance and change

## Objects of Worship & Divine Power Source

- Worship: There is no singular deity in Druidics; instead, practitioners worship aspects of nature, elements, cycles, and celestial movements.
    
- Divine Power Flow:

	- Druidic practitioners establish a spiritual bond with the realm itself, allowing them to draw power from the fabric of nature.
	  
	- Upon death, their souls are knitted back into the essence of the land, ensuring that each generation’s spirit feeds into the next.
	  
	- Power is often drawn from sacred places, such as ancient groves, deep caves, high peaks, or shifting sands, depending on the belief system.

# Notable Druidic Traditions

- Magra (Bristecage) – Focuses on worship of Earth and Fire, seen as forces of creation and destruction. Practitioners carve their histories into living rock formations growing to be preserved by the land itself.

- Galus (Nandras Bay) – Centers around Air and Water, emphasizing fluidity, adaptation, and change. Followers use wind-sculpted shells to record knowledge, letting the elements decide which information endures.

- Arozis (Dossix) – Practiced by the Lizardfolk of Wrenmere Mire and the Sabre Coast, revering swamps, tidal cycles, and the relationship between predator and prey.

- Anisism (Deepwood) – A Leshy belief that considers plants the true consciousness of the realm, with Leshies acting as mere vessels for an ancient, collective wisdom.

- Barat (Deepwood) – A warrior-philosophy among Leshies, teaching that decay is as sacred as life, and the role of destruction is to make space for new growth.

- Audway (Sharandar Wood) – Practiced by the Tripkee tribes, focusing on revering the rivers and unseen connections in nature.


# Key Aspects & Religious Practices

1. Living Landmarks – Certain groves, stones, and waterways are considered repositories of wisdom, containing memories from past practitioners.

2. Elemental Harmonization – Some sects use attunement practices to allow practitioners to physically embody aspects of their chosen element, this is most common amongst Genasi tribes who already possess minor elemental attributes.

3. Resonant Kinship – Followers often believe they are spiritually descended from the creatures or landscapes they protect, considering themselves guardians of their ancestral lands.

4. The Silence of the Old Ones – Some groups within the Deepwood commune with nature in absolute silence, believing words diminish their ability to listen to the will of the world.

5. The Breath of the Realm – Some practitioners claim that the realm itself breathes, and aligning one’s breath with natural rhythms allows for deepened understanding and connection.

6. Sacred Rot – Some sects within both The Wrenmire and The Deepwood believe that decay is as sacred as growth, cultivating mushrooms, lichen, and decomposing materials as spiritual offerings.

Druidics is not a singular faith, but a tapestry of naturalistic beliefs that are deeply tied to regional landscapes and elemental forces. Unlike structured religions, Druidic practitioners see themselves as caretakers rather than worshippers, believing that their connection to nature is an ongoing dialogue rather than a doctrine.

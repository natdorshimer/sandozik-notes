Origination & Historical Development

- Founded in the 2nd century, when the first Exalt survived the Awakening Ritual, proving themselves the strongest psionic entity and the foundation of Psiol.
    
- Unlike other magics, psionics were never affected by The Sunder, allowing the Gith to weather the collapse of magic and thrive while others faltered.
    
- Using psionics and recovered arcanotech, the Gith built flying ships and sacred bonds with dragons, allowing them to dominate the Spine Mountains and raid other nations.
    
- Every Exalt inherits the psionic abilities of their predecessors, meaning each successor is the most powerful version to exist.
    
- The 5th Exalt has just been declared, following the assassination of the 4th Exalt by an unknown group of assassins who immediately killed themselves upon delivering a fatal wound.
    
- The Exalt’s first public appearance is set for three days after the campaign start, with the entire Gith population in a state of anxiety and expectation.
    

Core Beliefs & Structure

1. The Exalt is All – The Exalt is the center of the Psionic Network, and absolute loyalty is demanded. Any mention of betrayal is met with immediate execution.
    
2. The Hierarchy Determines Worth – Social rank, psionic power, and battlefield success are the same thing. There is no separation between religious devotion, combat ability, and social status.
    
3. Dragons as Sacred Partners – The Gith have forged psionic bonds with dragons, treating them as divine creatures that serve alongside them in conquest.
    

The Trial of Worth & The Awakening Ritual

- All Gith children grow up in work camps, overseen by Caretakers.
    
- At ages 8-13, children undergo the Trial of Worth, a lethal psionic ritual meant to awaken their psionic potential.
    

- 1 in 5 die instantly.
    
- Survivors display varying levels of psionic aptitude.
    

- If a child displays extraordinary psionic talent, they are declared a Prodigy and removed from the work camps, sent to facilities to prepare for the Awakening Ritual.
    
- The Awakening Ritual determines the next Exalt, with the previous Exalt’s power swiftly leaving them upon a new successor's success.
    
- Only 1 in 4,000 Prodigies survive the Awakening Ritual. A new Exalt only emerges every two centuries on average.
    
- The ritual always coincides with major Gith historical shifts, and this most recent transition was no exception.
    

Object of Worship & Divine Power Source

- Object of Worship: The Exalt and the Psionic Network that connects all Gith.
    
- Source of Psionic Power:
    

- Psionics are innate to the Gith but must be unlocked through the Trial of Worth.
    
- Once awakened, a Gith’s psionic strength is directly tied to their place in The Hierarchy.
    
- The Exalt is the ultimate psionic conduit, regulating and amplifying the entire network.
    

Key Aspects & Practices

1. The Thoughbound Crucible – A mandatory psionic dueling arena where any Gith can challenge a superior for their rank. This ensures that only the strongest and most cunning hold power.
    
2. The Hierarchy – A strict ranking system that determines privileges, influence, and military command. The higher one’s rank, the greater their connection to the Exalt.
    
3. Dreamwrought Construction – The Gith construct cities, weapons, and ships using combined psionic effort, shaping raw materials purely through thought.
    
4. Mandatory Devotion in Ahl’Vrakeer – Every Gith in Ahl’Vrakeer must contribute at least one hour per day to psionic meditation, reinforcing the Exalt’s Network.
    
5. The Silent Caste – Those who failed the Awakening Ritual and attempted to pledge fealty to themselves instead of the Exalt. Now shattered and mindless, they are hyper-violent, immensely powerful psionic beings, reined in only by the Exalt’s control.
    
6. Immediate Execution for Treason – Speaking of betraying the Exalt or The Hierarchy is punishable by instant public execution.
    

Religious Leadership & The Generals

The Gith do not have religious figures, as religion, warfare, and government are the same structure. The Exalt rules absolutely, with seven Generals serving beneath them.

The Exalt (Unnamed, Age 13)

- The newly awakened 5th Exalt has yet to speak publicly.
    
- Was discovered in a quarry work camp, an unexpected background for an Exalt.
    
- Their abilities remain unknown, but rumors suggest they awakened before the 4th Exalt had fully died.
    
- Their public address is scheduled for three days after the campaign start, leaving Gith society in uncertainty and anticipation.
    

General Zaryth Veylan (The Warlord, Age 189)

- Most senior of the Generals, having survived over two centuries of conquest.
    
- Has personally led and won raids against Trirevivar and Oftwinter, taking hostages, resources, and weapons.
    
- His psionic prowess allows him to perceive battlefield movements before they happen, making him an unstoppable tactician.
    
- Rides the great dragon Avarithis, a 250-year-old obsidian-scaled beast who has burned entire towns to cinders in Gith raids.
    
- Rumors whisper that Zaryth secretly desired the position of Exalt, but such claims are never spoken aloud for fear of immediate execution.
    

General Syriat "The Unseen Blade" Yzaren (Age 76)

- Master of psionic stealth, subterfuge, and assassination.
    
- Has led multiple silent strikes against rival Gith factions and eliminated political threats before they could gain influence.
    
- Can walk through crowds unnoticed, even by other psionic users, due to her unique ability to mask her presence entirely from the mental plane.
    
- Rides Vexorith, a sleek midnight-blue dragon, who shares her ability to vanish at will.
    
- Unlike the other Generals, she believes the new Exalt should not yet be trusted—but keeps these doubts hidden beneath absolute obedience.
    

General Vael'Koroth (The Executioner, Age 122)

- Oversees internal order and loyalty enforcement, ensuring absolute compliance with the Exalt’s will.
    
- Wields psionic domination, capable of breaking the minds of traitors and turning them into mindless husks.
    
- Leads public executions of anyone who speaks against The Hierarchy, reinforcing Gith unity through fear and devotion.
    
- His dragon, Drezarith, is a monstrous, battle-scarred beast who personally devours those sentenced to execution.
    
- Considered utterly merciless, but respected as a necessary force of discipline.
    

Summary

Psiol is a harsh, militaristic theocracy where loyalty, combat ability, and religious devotion are the same. The Exalt is worshiped as the most powerful being, and only the strongest survive. The new Exalt’s rise is unprecedented, and Gith society teeters between chaos and a new era of conquest.

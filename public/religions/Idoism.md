3. Progressing Scientific, Technological, or Societal Goals is Religious Service – Any meaningful contribution to the advancement of civilization is an act of worship, and invention is a sacred pursuit.
    

# Object of Worship & Divine Power Source

- ## Objects of Worship:

	- The Pharon Jewels, immense arcanotech-infused crystals that power the Canopy Towns. Maintained by the Canopy Council.
	  
	- On a spiritual level, followers worship the concept of technology and societal advancement, seeing progress as an inherently divine pursuit.

- ## Divine Energy Flow:

	- Divine magic is drawn from the Pharon Jewel system, with each town possessing a centralized Pharon Jewel that radiates energy. These Pharon Jewels are charged through practitioner worship.
	
	- Practitioners within the canopy towns can access divine power directly, allowing for miraculous technological advancements and arcane innovations.
	
	- Within the past three decades, the invention of Pharus Foci has revolutionized the faith. These are essentially handheld personal Pharon Jewels, allowing Idoist clerics to wield divine power remotely.
	
	- Pharus Foci must be periodically recharged through ritualistic energy replenishment, typically performed during rest periods.
	
	- As Pharus Foci become more common, Idoism is slowly expanding beyond the Canopy Towns, no longer requiring physical proximity to a primary Pharon Jewel.
    

# Origination & Historical Development

- Idoism was born from the philosophies of the Curators, a secretive society that hoarded and safeguarded magical artifacts and arcanotech to prevent misuse by the power-hungry.
    
- In the 7th century, the Curators gathered enough resources to establish the Canopy Towns, constructing entire cities high in the trees of Gundalun.
    
- The first settlement, Anhurst, started with only 400 inhabitants, but soon became a hub for arcanotech research and development.
    
- In the 8th century, the invention of the Pharon Jewels solidified Idoism as a religious movement, as these structures offered a reliable source of divine power to practitioners.
    
- Over time, Idoists refined their technological innovations, culminating in the creation of Pharus Foci in the three prior to the start of the campaign, which are now expanding the reach of the faith beyond the Canopy Towns.
    
- The faith remains centered around technological advancement and communal well-being, with a strong focus on ethical innovation and societal equity.
    

# Key Aspects & Religious Practices

1. The Pharon Linkage Ceremony – Initiates of Idoism undergo a ritual to attune themselves to a Pharon Jewel, granting them the ability to channel divine energy and arcanotech functions.

2. Techwright Gatherings – Annual assemblies of engineers, scholars, and clerics, where practitioners collaborate on technological advancements and discuss ethics in invention. Most inventions from guilds, groups, notable independent inventors, or the fledgling companies are unveiled during these events.

3. The Pharatus Channeling System - Pharon Gems are charged through worship from followers, either at the Pharon gems themselves, which serve as churches of a sort, or at channeling points throughout the towns and in buildings, called Vosk Ports, which are connected to the gems through arcanotech 'wiring'. Within the past several years, prototypes of solar generators have been attached to the system, seeing moderate success.

4. Coexistent Spirituality - Idoism does not take issue with the worship of any religions that do not directly conflict with the laws of the Canopy Towns (being Mavor), and there are a fair amount of both Fairtrade and Druidic practitioners that live in the Canopy Towns and practice Idoism

5. Innovation as Worship – Clerics and researchers dedicate their projects to the faith, seeing new inventions as acts of reverence to progress itself. There are few formal religious titles within the following, but titles like 'engineer' and 'doctor' serve similar religious importance. Collectives will often gather together to petition the council for changes, with several of these being formal organizations of titled individuals.

6. Ethical Development Mandates – A set moral framework ensures that technological innovations do not exploit or oppress, reinforcing the balance between societal health and advancement. This framework does little to guide lifestyle beyond condemning human and animal right violations, instead encouraging self-expression. However, breaking such mandates can lead to an individual being cut off from the Pharon system, making it near impossible to effectively live within the Canopy Towns.

# Religious Leaders

1. High Arca Engineer Eron Vosk (Genasi Techwright, Age 132)
	- One of the most respected figures in Idoism’s scientific community, overseeing advancements in Pharus Foci technology and magic item development in general.
	
	- Played a crucial role in expanding the efficiency and accessibility of portable Pharon power sources, leading to him becoming a household name with the Vosk Ports. This led to the creation of Vosk Tech, a company based out of Reineer focused on arcanotech development.
	
	- Often leads the annual Techwright Gatherings (though this role shifts between prominent figures), having presented dozens of inventions over the decades at the Gatherings.
	
	- Though wealth distribution is generally balanced within the Canopy Towns, Vosk and his family are unquestionably the wealthiest people that currently live in them. 
    
2. Prime Curator Aelric Tandras (Dwarven Archivist, Age 287)

	- Preserves the ancient records of the Curators, ensuring that past knowledge is never lost.
	
	- Advocates for historical preservation alongside advancement, arguing that past wisdom must guide future progress.
	
	- Frequently oversees restoration projects, particularly those involving reclaimed or lost arcanotech from before the Shattering.
	
	- Has previously served on the Canopy Electate and is a key advisor for the body.
    

3. Synthesist Veya Lioren (Catfolk Inventor, Age 55)

	- A leading figure in the practical application of divine energy into everyday life, specializing in Pharus-enhanced public utilities.
	
	- Heads community-driven projects that integrate Idoist principles into urban development outside the Canopy Towns, such as community fountains that draw water from surrounding mist and freezer facilities for long-term food and bio storage.
	
	- Works closely with scholars in Oftwinter, helping spread Idoism to regions that were once unreachable due to technological limitations.
    

# Summary

Idoism is a progress-driven faith, blending technological advancement with spiritual fulfillment. Its followers believe that scientific and societal progress are inseparable, and that fostering one inherently benefits the other. The Canopy Towns remain the heart of the faith, but with the emergence of Pharus Foci, the religion is expanding its influence beyond its treetop origins. As Idoism continues to grow, its principles of ethical innovation and communal prosperity shape its future trajectory, ensuring that progress remains a force for good.

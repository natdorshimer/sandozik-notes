Origination & Historical Development

- Began forming after The Sunder ended as fragmented demonic cults sought power and indulgence.
    
- Gained traction in the 5th century, particularly in regions where lawless or destructive ideologies thrived, such as The Spine Mountains and the Vranir Tundra.
    
- Became "official" in Marrowmeld, where several demonic warlords cemented their power through ritualistic worship based in the religion, with some showing examples of how the process can transform any mortal or demon into a beast of destruction.
    
- Frequently persecuted, most non-demonic governing bodies have banned this religion due to its inherent societal harm.
    
- Several underground cults continue to operate in secrecy, while it can be openly practiced in Wrenmere Mire.
    

Core Beliefs & Structure

1. Hedonism as Divine Right – Followers embrace excessive indulgence in violence, pleasure, and pain, believing these sensations bring them closer to demonic transcendence.
    
2. Sadomasochism as Devotion – Self-inflicted pain and ritualized torture are seen as a means of strengthening one’s will, while inflicting suffering upon others is an assertion of dominance and divine favor.
    
3. Power Through Consumption – Followers seek power through consuming the energy of other living beings, often through dark rituals, sacrificial rites, or pacts with demon lords.
    

  
  

Object of Worship & Divine Power Source

- Objects of Worship: Demon Lords, Torture, Mutation
    
- Divine Energy Flow:
    

- Followers gain power by forming pacts with demon lords, exchanging obedience and cruelty for supernatural strength.
    
- They also absorb energy from the suffering and life force of others, often through ritualized consumption and sacrificial offerings.
    
- The most devoted experience grotesque mutations, warping their forms into beings of enhanced strength, perception, or magical affinity.
    

Key Aspects & Religious Practices

1. Rites of Flesh – Worshippers undergo extensive body modifications, such as scars, burns, or magical alterations, to prove their devotion.
    
2. Pactbound Rituals – Followers conduct elaborate blood oaths to bind themselves to demonic patrons, ensuring a lifetime of service in exchange for greater power.
    
3. Feast of Agony – A grand ritual performed in tribes across the Spine Mountains where followers sacrifice captives en masse, consuming their life force while invoking blessings from demon lords.
    
4. The Unchained Warbands – Mavor devotees frequently form mercenary groups or raiding parties, bringing destruction and suffering to non-believers. These are often performed as psuedo-pilgrimages.
    
5. Demonic Revival - Mavor serves a very important function in that any beings that make pacts with a Demon Lord will have their souls forfeited to said Demon Lord. Demon Lords are able to form lesser demons out of raw energy. Since nearly every demon pledges itself to one of these Lords, the demonic population is more or less 'recycled' in this way. This is why the demonic population remains so large even centuries out from The Shattering.
    
6. Demonic Ascendance – The most faithful aspire to mutate their forms completely, ascending into lesser demons or even fiendish beings capable of making pacts with lesser beings.
    

Religious Leaders

1. Grand Torturer Vexilar Bloodskin (Demonic High Priest, Age Unknown)
    

- An ancient demon-bound orc, heavily scarred and physically mutated through centuries of ritualistic worship. Functionally a demon lord at this point, but he still takes pride in orcish heritage.
    
- Oversees Marrowmeld’s major ceremonies, personally leading the Feast of Agony. Ensures prosperity for the orcish tribes in the Spine Mountains. Often leads mobs against lesser Demon Lords who he dislikes.
    
- Claims to hear the voices of multiple demon lords, making him one of the most feared spiritual figures among Mavor practitioners.
    

1. Whispering Malice Y’Zell (Gnomish Occultist, Age 143)
    

- A reclusive, yet highly influential figure operating in underground cults across Sandozik, flitting between them at inexplicable speeds.
    
- She is actually despised by many demons due to her sharing of the religion with non-demons, but she sees ample support from her Demon Lord patron Crator.
    
- Known for ritualistic body magic, permanently warping her followers through twisted blessings.
    
- Leads The Scarlet Veil, a secretive sect that infiltrates governments and trade networks to spread Mavor influence.
    

1. The Flayed Prophet Vaarkhul (Demon-Kholo Hybrid, Age 300+)
    

- Born from a macabre demon-Kholo union ritual, he is half-mortal, half-fiend from birth. This has also elevated him to mythical status among the Kholo tribes of the Vranir Tundra
    
- Resides deep in the Spine Mountains, rumored to be forming an armor of mutated monstrosities.
    
- His body continuously regenerates and mutates, a sign of his fundamental connection to abyssal energy.
    
- Followers believe he will one day break reality itself, allowing the demon lords to fully manifest within Sandozik. This is backed by the fact that no divination magic is able to see past the year 1069, which most within the religion attribute to the unknowable nature of abyssal energies.
    

Summary

Mavor is a brutal and forbidden faith, rooted in pain, excess, and raw power. It thrives in lawless or demonic regions, and its followers believe that through suffering and sacrifice, they will achieve demonic transcendence. The religion remains outlawed in most of Sandozik, yet its underground influence persists, keeping its violent creed alive through hidden cults and mercenary bands.

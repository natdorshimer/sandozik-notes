# Core Beliefs & Structure

1. Commerce as Sacred Exchange – Trade is not just economic, but a divine act that sustains the bonds between people. Fair and honest trade strengthens both individuals and society.
    
2. Community as the Bedrock of Prosperity – Strong communities ensure mutual benefit, ensuring that everyone thrives. Hoarding wealth without circulation is considered spiritually stagnant.
    
3. Equality of Worth and Opportunity – All beings have equal potential to contribute to society, and wealth should be used to uplift rather than dominate.
    

# Object of Worship & Divine Power Source

- The Spirit of Waukeen: The fragmented divine essence of Waukeen, passed down and distributed across her worshippers.
    
- Divine Energy Flow: Unlike other faiths that centralize divine power into a single deity, Fairtrade followers believe that each of them holds a spark of Waukeen’s essence, which is strengthened through trade and honorable economic interactions.
    
- Fairtrade Temples hold Toral (Holy Currency), where followers can return divine-infused currency to the faith, symbolizing continuous exchange with Waukeen’s spirit.
    

# Key Aspects & Religious Practices

1. Fairtrade Altars & Exchange Temples – Places where worshippers trade goods or services in symbolic acts of faith, reinforcing mutual prosperity.
    
2. The Freehold Pact – The legal and spiritual foundation of Wakual’s governance is based on Fairtrade principles, ensuring honest dealings and protection of commerce. As such, the Oftwinter Monarchy is not a big fan of the religion but knows they cannot crack down within their lands due to the fact that a large majority of Oftwinter civilians are already Fairtrade followers.
    
3. The Merchant's Oath – Devout merchants take a binding vow of honest trade, and if broken, the Spirit of Waukeen may withdraw favor (resulting in bad fortune or failed ventures).
    
4. Blessed Commerce Festivals – Held quarterly but not pinned down to specific dates, involving public markets, ritual exchanges, and divine auctions where items imbued with Waukeen’s lingering blessings are circulated.
    
5. Community-Led Trade Disputes – Rather than courts, major economic disputes among Fairtrade followers are settled through public democratic votes, where the community decides on resolutions in the spirit of fairness and prosperity for all.
    

Religious Banking & Wealth Redistribution – The wealthiest Fairtrade followers are spiritually mandated to reinvest portions of their wealth into community programs, effectively acting as a divine tithe.**

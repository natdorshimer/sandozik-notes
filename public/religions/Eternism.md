# Origination & Historical Development

- Formed from the celestials released during The Shattering, who sought to create a structured society based on divine purity.
    
- The Ora Well was established in the 3rd century, serving as a celestial power reservoir and anchor for divine magic. The Hyrune Cathedral was built around this well in later centuries, with the town of Goldrisen growing around it.
    
- Throughout the 2nd century, the celestials focused on rebuilding Trirevivar and surrounding settlements, bringing order to a chaotic post-Shattering world.
    
- The 4th century saw the formalization of Aflairen, as celestial leaders established a structured government to enforce their divine mandate.
    
- Eternism was officially declared the state religion shortly after, with all other faiths being forbidden. Over the following centuries, non-believers were either converted or exiled, though some resistance still exists in areas near The Deepwood.
    
- The faith's influence is beginning to expand beyond Aflairen, with missionaries spreading its tenets, though they face resistance in regions unwilling to accept celestial rule.

	- Upon a follower's death, their soul is absorbed into the Ora Well, further strengthening it and granting passage to a divine afterlife existing within the stars above.
	
	- The Oren Council distributes divine power from the Ora Well, granting miracles, blessings, and divine magic to the faithful.
	
	- The well is currently gaining energy faster than it loses, allowing it to act as a divine bank for celestial beings and granting immense power to the Oren Council.

# Summary

Eternism is a rigidly structured faith, built upon devotion to celestial beings, purity of the soul, and strict adherence to moral law. Through the Ora Well, divine energy is both granted and stored, and a passage to an afterlife of peace and prosperity is created. This makes the Oren Council and their followers one of the most magically sustained religious orders in Sandozik. Goldrise serves as the spiritual heart of Eternism, with the faith continuing to grow as the Ora Well accumulates ever greater power.

Stellaire is a world sitting upon the edge of transformation, a place where the past is all but forgotten and the future is unwritten. Those willing to brave the unknown will shape what comes next, with unforeseen challenges around every turn. Once scattered and isolated, its many realms are finally reconnecting, bringing both opportunity and danger in equal measure. This is a land of discovery, clashing cultures, abundant magic, and untamed frontiers, where every step forward could change the course of history.

Over a millennium has passed since The Shattering, the cataclysm that broke reality itself, leaving behind a scattered cosmos of self-contained realms adrift in a swirling sea of nonexistence known as The Veil, lit only by the Elemental Coil above. These once isolated fragments are now reconnecting, forming a web of newly opened pathways that beckon the daring and the desperate alike. Magic, all but destroyed after The Sunder’s near-total collapse of the Weave, is just now reaching its previous potency. This brings with it both forgotten wonders and unforeseen arcane terrors.

Each realm is a world unto itself, defined by its own deity, essence, and laws of existence. Some are lands of elemental storms and boundless wilderness, others cradle burgeoning civilizations or harbor alien landscapes. Conflicts simmer as rich cultures collide in trade, war, and uneasy alliances. The gods, still relatively new to this world, now walk their realms in a variety of roles, from rulers to hunter to prisoners, all tied inexorably to the lands they sustain. And beyond the known reaches of reality, The Veil still hungers, its unknowable entities watching, waiting. Those who venture across Stellaire will not merely explore; they will fight for survival, for dominion, or for something greater, the very soul of this fragile, reforming world.

The party begins their journey as hired hands on a job in the Vranir Tundra, taking on contract work like countless others looking to carve out their place in Sandozik’s ever-evolving landscape. Its people are as varied as its terrain, from the tribes and mountain-top citadels of the Spine Mountains to the bustling ports along the stormy coast. Traders, scholars, mercenaries, and inventors all thrive here, driven by a mix of ambition, necessity, and the relentless push for progress. With no knowledge of anything beyond The Veil’s swirling mists, the people of Sandozik have built their world on their own terms, adapting to scarce farmland and arcanic unbalances, forging new technologies, and shaping cultures as distinct as the land itself. For now, the party’s focus is simple—make a name, earn some coin, and see where the work takes them. But soon, their world will grow far larger than anyone ever imagined.

The scale of the journey ahead is staggering. Over 130 realms exist, ranging in size from vast landscapes akin to the New England states in size, with many being part of larger nations. Dozens of cultures and regions exist, with hundreds of types of weapons, armaments, and magic items mapped out across them. The party’s tale will unfold across ten grand arcs, taking them from scattered wanderers thrust into the unknown to the first pioneers to truly map and understand Stellaire’s vast, shifting geography. They will uncover forgotten ruins from the lost age, barter with deities and warlords, and challenge forces beyond mortal reckoning. They will become legends, if they survive long enough to reap the rewards of the countless perils.

### Essence

Essence is a fundamental force within the realms of World Waker, an energy intertwined with a creature’s soul, body, and true name. It serves as both a source of power and a reflection of an individual’s nature, developing over time and shaping abilities in profound ways. All living beings possess Essence, though its strength and complexity vary based on their lifespan, innate potential, and the energy surrounding them. Most creatures of significant power wield two different Essences, which evolve alongside them.

For players and other significant entities, Essence follows a structured progression based on Challenge Rating (CR) and player level:

| Essence Type | Creature CR | Player Level | Max Feature Lvl |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Knack        | 0           | 1            | 4               |
| Talent       | 4           | 5            | 8               |
| Gift         | 8           | 9            | 12              |
| Nature       | 12          | 13           | 16              |
| Legacy       | 16          | 17           | 20              |
| Mandate      | Deity       | Deity        | None            |

Additionally, deities possess a unique and exclusive form of Essence known as Mandates. Each deity has two Mandates, which are based on the realm’s essence. When a deity is overthrown or willingly relinquishes their position, the Mandates are transferred to the new deity, shifting its nature to reflect their influence.

Upon gaining a Talent, a creature also acquires the option to gain an additional Knack, creating a dual-Essence progression. This logic follows through, and a being that attains a Legacy will have access to both a legacy and a nature. Moreover, a creature can choose to ‘progress’ the essences that they already possess to more powerful forms, though this does require the sacrifice of an additional essence of the type that is being progressed to (typically captured and stored within an Anam gem).

### Essence and Its Interactions

For most creatures, Essence is an immutable part of their being, inseparable until death, at which point it disperses into the surrounding realm. If a creature were to survive this unbinding process, it would be permanently damaged—fractured across body, name, and soul.

However, player characters and denizens of Sandozik are different. Unlike others, they can remove, exchange, and alter their Essence, making Essence a fluid force within their society. This dynamic nature plays a crucial role in politics, commerce, and personal development within Sandozik. Some other beings exist with this trait, though it is very rare to see in other realms.

| Essence Type | 1/Rest Spell Casting | Bonus to Atk Type (Either Melee, Ranged, or Magic) | Bonus to Specific Trained Skill |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Knack        | 2                    | +1                                                 | +2                              |
| Talent       | 4                    | +2                                                 | +4                              |
| Gift         | 6                    | +4                                                 | +7                              |
| Nature       | 8                    | +5                                                 | +9                              |
| Legacy       | 10                   | +7                                                 | +12                             |
| Mandate      | 10++                 | +10                                                | +20                             |

Modifying Essence is not instantaneous and requires weeks of focused effort, this is conducted as a downtime activity. Despite this flexibility, the following restrictions apply:

- No creature can possess more than two Essences at any time. Creatures only capable of possessing a knack do not have a second Essence.
    
- Essence cannot be forcibly removed from another living being. To capture a creature’s Essence, it must be harvested at the moment of its death using specific techniques, spells, or tools.
    
- Essence cannot be full freeform in design (though it can modify and progress existing abilities and features in unique ways).
    
- Essence cannot be used to gain Features from Ancestries or Dedications that you do not already have access to, though you can gain an additional Dedication using Essence. Knacks cannot be used to gain base class features (only those gained as options when leveling, not those inherent to gaining a level).
    

It should be noted that some of these restrictions will be reduced or removed with higher types of Essence.
### Capturing and Storing Essence

Over centuries, various methods have emerged to extract and preserve Essence. The most reliable method involves Anam Crystals, rare formations that naturally occur in places of immense power. These crystals serve as vessels for Essence and are categorized into four tiers:

| Essence Type | Shard Type    |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Talent       | Lesser Shard  |
| Gift         | Greater Shard |
| Nature       | Chunk         |
| Legacy       | Core          |

In most realms, Core Shards are incredibly valuable, particularly those containing unique or powerful Essences. Many adventurers begin their careers by capturing creatures’ Essences in Lesser Shards, selling them for profit, and gradually working their way up to handling Greater Shards. Chunks and Cores are typically held by influential individuals or powerful organizations, though exceptions exist. Essence can also be released directly from an Anem Crystal 1/rest, though this has a significant chance of destroying the crystal along with the Essence it holds.

### Additional Features by Essence Type

| Essence Type | Addition Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Talent       | Allows for bundling of prerequisite features (e.g., a level 6 ability + level 2 prerequisite counts as a level 8 feature).                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Gift         | Allows for bundling of any two features within the same class. Allows for the removal/addition of a tag to two specific features or spells of the player's choice. Allows for the taking of a Dedication and a lvl 6 or lower feature from the Dedication.                                                  |
| Nature       | Allows for bundling of three features within a class or two features from any classes. Allows for the removal/addition of two tags from two specific abilities or skills, or one tag from four features or spells. Allows for the taking of a Dedication and a lvl 10 or lower feature from the Dedication. |
| Legacy       | Allows for bundling of three features from any classes. Allows for the removal/addition of two tags from two specific abilities or skills, or one tag from four features or spells. Allows for the taking of a Dedication and a lvl 14 or lower feature from the Dedication.                                |

### Essence Extraction Techniques

The following methods are commonly used to capture Essence at the moment of a creature’s death:

#### Spells

- Soul Snag (1st Level, Reaction, 15 ft) – When a creature dies, you can ensnare its Essence and store it in a valid Anam Crystal within 5 feet of the target.
    
- Soul Rend (3rd Level, 2 Action, 60 ft, Divine) – Deals 7d6 force damage. If this kills the target, its Essence is stored in the nearest valid Anam Crystal within 10 feet of the target. If the target survives, it must make a Will save. On failure, its Essence will still be captured if it dies within one minute.
    
- Soul Bind (5th Level, Concentration, 2 action, 60 ft, 1 Minute) – Binds a creature’s Essence to a valid Anam Crystal within 5 feet of the caster and 60 feet of the target. If the creature dies while the spell is active and in range, its Essence is automatically stored. Spell must be sustained.
    
#### Items

- Philter of De-Souling (Level 2, Poison, Weapon Coating) – The next attack that hits within one round makes the target vulnerable to Essence capture on a DC 15 Will ST. If it dies within that round, its Essence is stored in the nearest valid Anam Crystal within 15 feet of the target.
    
- Soul Net Generator (Level 6, Single Use, 60 ft, 3 Turn Duration) – Creates a 15 ft radius field. Any creature that dies within this field has its Essence automatically stored in a valid Anam Crystal within 30 feet. The field lasts until one Essence is captured or until the duration expires.

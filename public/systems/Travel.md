# About
The Travel System in World Waker is designed to instill a sense of survival and discovery as players navigate the vast and diverse realms. Instead of detailing every step of a journey, this system focuses on key encounters, major obstacles, and straightforward resource management, allowing the campaign to emphasize pivotal moments while implying that smaller events and routine activities take place between them.

There are two primary types of travel:

- Known Realms – These are realms the party has previously crossed or completed significant objectives within. Travel here involves fewer encounters but presents more dangerous challenges.
    
- Unknown Realms – These are realms that the party has yet to explore. Traveling through unknown realms incurs more encounters, reflecting the unpredictability of uncharted territory.
    
Traveling through unknown realms consists of five encounters per realm, assuming no major detours or delays (not including connection-based encounters). Travel within a realm the party has already explored typically involves only one encounter, save for plot occurrences. Encounters stem from one of three sources: random encounter rolls, plot-related developments, and crossings between realms. These encounters can take the form of significant locations, settlements, unfolding events, combat, subplot developments, or even overwhelming threats where mere survival is the best possible outcome. Random encounters are determined using a 2d6 roll, where lower numbers result in more favorable outcomes.

An important concept within the travel system is Supplies. Discussed further later, the most important aspect at this point is that a party can have a max of 25 supplies (though this can be increased through various means), and use them while traveling. Supplies can be regained by foraging while traveling (to an extent) and can also be purchased in population centers. After every encounter the party will choose its pace for the next leg of the journey, which will use supplies and impacts allowed exploration activities and initiative modifier.

# Overview
There is a 50% chance of a rest between every, and the party decides when and if to take downtime, typically for recovery and scavenging supplies or when reaching a population center. After every encounter during travel, several steps occur before the next encounter in this order:

## The Travel Flow
1. [[Travel#Travelling#1. Choose Travel Pace|Party chooses pace and consumes supplies]]
2. [[Travel#Travelling#2. Travel and Exploration Activities|Party takes exploration activities]]
3. Party rolls to see if rest occurs (50/50)
4. [[Travel#Travelling#4. Encounters|Party rolls for the next encounter]]

### Travel Through Known Realms
For travel through known realms, encounters are not triggered in every realm. Instead, for every four realms traveled, one encounter occurs. This is always a random encounter, though plot-related events may still unfold during the journey. When rolling for encounters in known realms, the party adds +1 to the encounter roll for each realm crossed, up to a maximum of +4. If this addition results in a roll over 12, a d6 is rolled to determine the encounter:

- 1-3: Result is treated as a roll of 10
- 4-5: Result is treated as a roll of 11
- 6: Result is treated as a roll of 12

If the modified roll exceeds 12, the difference between the total and the assigned encounter is carried forward as a modifier for the next random encounter roll. If the party is traveling more than four realms, this modifier stacks accordingly. If not, the process repeats with the adjusted modifier applied.

# Travelling

## 1. Choose Travel Pace

| Pace        | Supplies Consumed | Impacts                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Slow        | 7                 | Applies ‘Avoid Notice’ automatically to party, +2 to initiative                              |
| Normal      | 5                 | Party can use ‘move at half speed’ activities                                                |
| Fast        | 3                 | Party cannot use ‘move at half speed’ activities.                                            |
| Force March | 2                 | Party is immediately detected, -2 to initiative, cannot use ‘move at half speed’ activities. |

## 1b. Supplies & Resource Management

Supplies represent all necessities for survival, including food, crafting materials, maintenance items, exploration gear, easily purchased spell components, and general equipment. A party can carry a maximum of 25 supplies, though this limit can be increased through various means.

- Scavenging: The party can regain supplies while traveling. If they are above 10 supplies but at or below 20, they may scavenge up to 20. If they are at or below 10, they may only scavenge up to 10.
    
- Carrying Capacity: Additional supplies may be carried through companions, pack animals, wagons, and potentially other vehicles.
    

Supplies can be purchased at population centers at 5 sp per supply. Doing so will automatically repair all damaged, broken, and lost supply items. If supplies reach zero, the following penalties apply every rest roll:

- Fatigue: DC 15 Fortitude save or suffer -1 to all rolls (DC increases by +5 per consecutive encounter without supplies)
    
- Breakage: Two random supply items break and become unusable until replenished.
    
- Starvation: If the party fails to forage before this point, they get no health regeneration from rests and lose (level * 2) max HP, which can only be restored by consuming food (using supplies).

## 2. Travel and Exploration Activities

Players may each take an exploration activity between encounters while traveling. These represent the highlights of a journey, encapsulating skill-based actions that help the party adapt, prepare, or recover. While this amount may seem slight, it is also a representation of all the work the party has done to weather the many harmful events and combats that occur within this journey outside of the encounters being played through. Exploration activities may be performed when in exploration settings as normal, such as post-combat scenarios, dungeon navigation, or settlement downtime. Several exploration activities are modified within this system, with several new ones also being included. Notably, ‘move at half speed’ activities no longer apply directly, but instead can be used only when the party is traveling at slow or normal speed, and the ‘Avoid Notice’ activity can only be used during slow movement and is automatically applied to the party.

- New Activity - Forage: Forage for supplies while traveling, rolled against realm survival DC. +1 if moving normal speed, +2 if moving slow. Critical success gives 5 supplies, success gives 3 supplies, failure gives 1 supply, critical failure gives no supplies and deals xd4 dmg to player (x being survival DC of realm minus 12) 
    
- New Activity - Recuperate: Gain xd4 temp HP during following encounter (x being player level).
    
- Modified Activity - Search: Cannot use during forced march. -1
    
- Modified Activity - Scout: Can perform while moving at full speed, start up to 60 ft ahead of the party when entering a map for the following encounter.
    
- Modified Activity - Sense Direction: add +1 to the next encounter roll (+2 max per roll)
## 2b. Travel and Downtime

Downtime is always taken by player choice. It may occur in three primary instances:

- When arriving at a plot-related location within a populated area.
    
- When reaching a settlement and opting to take downtime.
    
- When supplies are depleted or injuries drive players to rest in the wilderness.
    

Standard Pathfinder 2e Downtime Rules apply, with additional survival-based considerations for forced downtime. Upon choosing to take Downtime in the wilderness, one player will use their first exploration activity to set up camp, making a survival check. Once every player takes two exploration activities, 4 supplies are consumed and a roll is
## 4. Encounters

| Roll Total | Encounter Type & Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2          | Good Realm Power Encounter – A powerful entity of the realm crosses paths with the party, offering aid, knowledge, or a significant boon. The worst outcome is neutral, while the best results in a major advantage for the players.                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3          | Major Population Center – The party arrives at one of the realm’s largest settlements, where they can engage in tradse, acquire services, and rest safely if they can afford it. Some realms may lack amenities, impacting what is available.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4          | Major Exploration Location / Minor Population Center – The party finds either a significant location worth exploring or a smaller settlement that provides rest and supplies. Exploration areas are relatively safe and often contain hidden points of interest, encounters, and loot.                                                                                                           |
| 5          | Minor Exploration Location – A remote area that allows the party a moment to catch their breath. The party may rest, explore, gather information, or find something useful without significant threat.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6          | Regular Combat Encounter – A standard battle occurs, which the party may be able to attempt to avoid through stealth or negotiation. Winning the fight allows rest. Getting past the threat without defeating it is an option as well, but will not offer a chance for rest.                                                                                                                     |
| 7          | Occurrence – A non-combat event happens, determined by a separate Occurrence Table (see below). These can be positive but are usually negative, affecting the party’s supplies, equipment, or future encounters.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8          | Difficult Combat Encounter – A particularly challenging battle occurs, often requiring deep strategy or significant resource expenditure. Winning the fight allows rest. Getting past the threat without defeating it is an option as well, but will not offer a chance for rest.                                                                                                                |
| 9          | World Barrier – A major obstacle blocks the path, such as an impassable cliff, a raging storm, or a monster’s territory. Circumventing it is possible but costly, and failure may result in severe setbacks.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10         | Dungeon Encounter – The party discovers an entrance to a dungeon. These areas are highly dangerous but contain Anam Shards and other valuable resources. Exploration may yield significant rewards or peril.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 11         | Deadly Combat Encounter – A high-risk battle with a powerful enemy or force. Slight errors can mean death, and even victory may come at great cost. The party must weigh their options carefully and will need to use creativity to overcome the threat. Winning the fight allows rest. Getting past the threat without defeating it is an option as well, but will not offer a chance for rest. |
| 12         | Bad Realm Power Encounter – The party draws the attention of a formidable force tied to the realm, such as an angry deity, a monstrous entity, or a powerful antagonist. The best outcome is escape, while the worst may be a total party kill.                                                                                                                                                  |

## 4b. Occurrences

Occurrences are events that occur on a result of 7 on the 2d6 encounter roll. These events do not occur as encounters, but instead as 3 consecutive 2d4 rolls that determine events that have impacted the party. The occurrences range from loss of supplies to modifiers to following encounters, with a variety of potential impacts.

| Roll | Outcome & Effect                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8    | Positive Event – Gain 1d4+1 supplies, find a minor item (party level -2), -20 XP budget reduction, or experience improved weather.                                                         |
| 7    | Benign Event – Gain or lose 1 supply, experience a weather shift (night, fog, storm), or find raw material related to the realm                                                            |
| 6    | Item Wear – The party loses 1d4+1 supplies, 2 supply items break and become unusable until repaired or replaced, or +10 XP budget increase to next combat encounter                        |
| 5    | Party Hits – Lose 1d6+2 supplies, suffer equipment damage (4d6+2 HP reduction to two equipped items), two characters contract afflictions (diseases or curses), or severe weather shift    |
| 4    | Negative Event – Lose 2d4+2 supplies, +20 XP budget to next encounter, or severe weather shift next 2 encounter                                                                            |
| 3    | Major Item Wear – Lose 3d4+2 supplies, five supply items break, +30 XP budget increase to next combat, or severe weather shift next 2 encounters                                           |
| 2    | Total Party Hit – The entire party suffers severe setbacks: Full equipment damage (6d6+4 HP reduction to all worn items), affliction contraction, or +40 XP budget increase to next combat |

The realm is harsh and the environment is unforgiving, be it the elemental infested jungles of Gundalun or the icy reaches of the spine mountain range. The largest city, Oftwinter, has 45,000 people. The realm as a whole has around 420,000. Approximately 120,000 of these numbers can be attributed to the demonic population of the divided nation of Krathga. Wakual is the second largest city with a population of 35,000 and bronze port is the third largest city with a population of 25,000. Any large town can be considered to have a population around 9,000-20,000. Any town or large tribal settlement can be considered to have a population of 4,000-9,000.

# Important Notes

- Food is currently a limiting factor to population growth. Much of the realm is not made up of easily farmed land, leading to a strong trade network and variety of solutions between the societies of the realm.
    
- The demons of Krathga and the celestials of Aflairen burst into the realm at the same time, being freed from a demiplane prison held within a halo that both sides had been trapped in. They were freed when an immense amount of energy was channeled into the halo during the Shattering. The populations inside both measured in the hundreds of thousands at that point, and the nature of the demi-plane made it so that they could never die, leading a millenia-long war inside the halo that drove most of them crazy. This war continued after they left the halo, but they could die. This led to a rapid decrease in both populations over the past centuries, with the demon population now measuring 100,000 and the celestial population measuring 7,900. Both groups are immortal in terms of lifespan. Neither group is capable of reproducing, though demons can propagate through a grotesque ritual involving mortal sacrifice. This has allowed the demonic population to stay the largest in the realm but has also put the demons of Krathga in conflict with every other surrounding nation (not that they mind this). Krathga does not really have a governing body so much as powerful tribal lords exerting influence over the others to cause a certain change. The war that the celestials stopped because Krathga has no governing body capable of directing war efforts or managing an economy.
